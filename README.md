# ePortfolio

This repository explains how I created my ePortfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone final project. Making a professional portfolio is one of the best ways to show employers my unique skills and talents. The ePortfolio is a good way to clearly present my abilities in the main areas of Computer Science. It includes work from different courses in the program that shows how I have grown in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

Some of the projects show my skills in one area while also showing strengths in other areas. As part of my own practice, I improved the projects and made them better than what the courses required. I fixed problems, improved quality, and made them more secure. The portfolio shows that I am highly motivated, organized, and skilled as a Computer Science major focusing on Software Engineering.
