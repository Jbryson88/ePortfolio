# ePortfolio

This repository documents my procedures for developing my ePortfolio as the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project. Creating a professional portfolio that showcases my unique abilities and talents is one of the best visual communication tools to demonstrate our value to potential employers. The content of the ePortfolio is a solid starting point to clear ideas that showcase my skills across the key fields of Computer Science. The included artifacts of some of the courses in the Computer Science Program represent my growth in the key categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

Some artifacts could demonstrate my skills in one category and illustrate skills across other key categories. As an own program practice, the artifacts chosen have been enhanced and presented beyond the course requirements, establishing a quality of work, addressing their limitations or inconsistencies, and mitigating vulnerabilities. The portfolio conveys the impression that I am strongly motivated, well organized, and accomplished in Computer Science major in Software Engineering.
