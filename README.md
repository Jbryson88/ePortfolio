# About Me

This repository explains how I created my ePortfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone final project. Making a professional portfolio is one of the best ways to show employers my unique skills and talents. The ePortfolio is a good way to clearly present my abilities in the main areas of Computer Science. It includes work from different courses in the program that shows how I have grown in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

Some of the projects show my skills in one area while also showing strengths in other areas. As part of my own practice, I improved the projects and made them better than what the courses required. I fixed problems, improved quality, and made them more secure. The portfolio shows that I am highly motivated, organized, and skilled as a Computer Science major focusing on Software Engineering.

I started the Computer Science program in September 2020 and have studied for about five years. I joined the program to improve my background in programming and developing applications and web services. I chose this path because I have always been passionate about working with computers and technology. I enjoy web development and have also led some IT projects and helped set up IT systems while working in the field of architecture.

During my time in the Computer Science program, I learned and improved many skills and gained a lot of knowledge. I became better at paying attention to details and thinking about security, which are both very important for working as a software engineer and developer. I also learned how to stay organized and careful when writing code by breaking it into smaller parts and testing it step by step. Testing is very important to make sure a program works well and does not have weaknesses or problems, and it becomes even more important as a project gets bigger and more complex. Thinking like a tester and always keeping security in mind are skills I continue to improve.

Working on big projects helped me learn how important the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is. I also learned how to use project management strategies whether I am working alone or with a team. Planning a large project takes a lot of organization, and it is important to work well with other people. Understanding what a client wants is part of the SDLC, and I learned how to turn those needs into algorithms and code. Being able to do that feels great and rewarding. These experiences have helped me improve soft skills like creativity, communication, time management, and teamwork.

Paying close attention to detail is an important part of writing high-quality code. It connects to reviewing code carefully, following security rules, and using professional coding practices. I learned that thinking about security early in a project is better than waiting until the end. This mindset supports a “zero trust” approach, which makes my code safer and more reliable. When I check my own code or review someone else’s, I often find small problems that were missed during development. Following coding standards and using clear formatting helps me write software that is easy to understand and fix later. I also ask classmates or coworkers to review my work. When someone else looks at it with fresh eyes, they can spot mistakes I may have overlooked. These experiences have helped me become better at catching details and sharing ideas clearly.

My experience as a U.S. Army veteran played a big role in building these habits. In the Army, I learned how to follow instructions, stay calm under pressure, and work with others as a team. I supported large military operations and handled important data for over 250 soldiers at a time. I helped develop and improve tracking systems using Excel and Python, which are now used by the U.S. Army TRADOC across many locations. I also worked with soldiers from other countries, including NATO forces, during training exercises in Europe. These experiences made me strong at solving problems, managing time, and communicating clearly with different groups of people. I now bring those same values to software development.

Throughout this program and my time in the military, I became more confident in learning new skills quickly. I approach problems with curiosity and a leadership attitude. My work in software development, data analysis, and technical writing is shown clearly in the artifacts in my ePortfolio. These skills, along with my military discipline and experience, make me a strong candidate for a software engineering role. I focus on writing code that not only works for computers, but is also clear and easy for people to understand and build on.

Each course in the Computer Science program has played an important role in helping me gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to pursue a career in this field. While I have learned a great deal outside of the classroom, certain courses had a greater impact and helped shape the direction I originally set out to follow when I joined the program. These courses helped me discover strengths I didn’t realize I had and gave me the chance to grow in areas I had not explored before. Because of that, I selected artifacts that clearly demonstrate and highlight the skills I gained from these experiences.

In CS250 Software Development Lifecycle, I learned how important the development process is and how strong communication with team members and clients supports a project’s success. IT145 Foundation in Application Development and CS260 Data Structures and Algorithms taught me valuable lessons about algorithms and data structures. These courses helped me strengthen my ability to design and evaluate solutions to real-world problems using proper computer science methods and design trade-offs. CS310 Collaboration and Team Project helped me understand the value of teamwork and showed how essential collaboration is for completing large-scale projects.

<p>Thermostat Lab Guide - CS350 Emerging Systems Architecture and Technologies</p>

CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming and CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization helped me understand the complexity of software design and computer graphics. In both courses, I showed that I could apply strong and creative techniques, tools, and skills to build computing solutions that add value and meet goals in the industry. CS340 Client and Server Development and DAT220 Fundamentals of Data Mining taught me how to create and use databases and showed how helpful data can be when solving problems. These courses also helped me learn how to create team environments where different people can work together and support decision-making in computer science.

The course artifacts I chose for the code reviews and the main categories of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases come from three different projects. Each one gave me a chance to use what I learned in class. I believe the changes I made to these projects show my growth and prove my skills in the computer science program.

The Computer Science program has helped me grow as a professional and has prepared me to build a meaningful and successful career. I am now ready to make valuable contributions to the field of computer science. Like a climber reaching the top of a mountain, I feel a renewed sense of motivation and focus. I have created an ePortfolio that reflects my place among computer science professionals, and I am proud of this achievement.

My ePortfolio shows that I can use solid and creative techniques. I built computer solutions that provide real value and meet specific goals in the industry. One example of this is my project where I worked with CSV data files, importing them into MongoDB, using the PyMongo driver, Python libraries, the Dash framework, and a CRUD module. These tools allowed me to manage the data and build useful web-based features.

I also designed and improved solutions that solve problems using algorithmic thinking and strong computer science practices. I made careful design choices by working with classes, methods, arguments, and variables in Java. Each artifact I enhanced shows my focus on security. I worked to spot possible weaknesses, reduce design flaws, and protect private data and resources.

I am excited to take on new challenges that help me grow. I stay committed to completing my work, even when it is difficult. I believe in asking for help when needed, and I see it as a way to learn from more experienced coworkers and mentors. I want to be part of a team that works together to build creative and useful solutions. I bring strong organization skills, a love of learning, and a positive attitude. I am ready to explore new technologies and build the skills needed to succeed. I am motivated to keep pushing forward and to do my best in every opportunity.

<h1>Artifact One - Travlr Application - Full Stack</h1>

The artifact I chose for this milestone is my Travlr App. This is a web application that helps users plan and organize trips. It lets users create an account, log in, save trip details, add destinations, and see an itinerary. I originally created this app in my Web Application Development course.
Why I Selected This Artifact
I selected the Travlr App because it shows many important skills in software design and engineering. It has a full stack architecture with a front end, back end, and a database, which demonstrates my ability to design and build a complete application. Some parts of the app that showcase my skills include the registration and login system with password hashing, the CRUD operations for trips and destinations, and the clean and responsive user interface.
For this milestone, I completed a set of enhancements to improve the app’s quality. I improved the backend by fixing response logic and adding better input validation to the trips.js controller. I improved error handling and replaced unclear errors with specific, helpful messages. On the frontend, I added a responsive navigation bar, breadcrumbs to show users where they are in the site, and better input validation on the contact form. I also updated the CSS to include media queries for better mobile and tablet responsiveness.

These enhancements helped me meet some of the program’s outcomes, like using solid software engineering practices and tools, and improving security in my design by validating user input. My outcome coverage plan has not changed because my enhancements stayed focused on making the app more secure, maintainable, and user-friendly.
Reflection on the Process
Working on these enhancements taught me a lot about why clean and secure code matters. I learned how moving business logic into cleaner, more maintainable code and adding good validation make the app more reliable. I also learned how responsive design and user-friendly error messages improve usability. A challenge I faced was making sure my backend changes didn’t break existing functionality and testing my CSS changes on different screen sizes. Overall, I am proud of the improvements I made and feel more confident in my ability to deliver professional-quality software.


1: Backend: Improved Input Validation and Error Handling
•	Added validation to the trips.js controller for tripCode parameter to ensure it is provided and valid.
•	Fixed the response logic to correctly return 200 if a trip is found, or 404 with a clear message if not.
•	Added proper server error handling (500) with helpful error output.
2: Frontend: Navigation and Usability
•	Added a responsive navigation bar to the top of each page (index.html, about.html, contact.html), with links to all main sections of the site.
•	Added breadcrumbs below the navbar on each page to show the user’s current location.
3: Frontend: Input Validation
•	Added required attributes to form inputs and textareas in contact.html to prevent submitting empty forms and improve user experience.
4: Frontend: Responsive Design
•	Added media queries to styles.css to make the site look better on tablets and mobile screens.
•	Adjusted layout so navbar stacks vertically on small screens and buttons and text resize appropriately.

<H1>Add Trip</H1>
<img width="75%" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jbryson88/ePortfolio/refs/heads/main/enhancement/CS%20465%20-%20Full%20Stack%20Software%20Development/Add%20Trip.png"/>
I created a form that allowed me to add a new trip to the system. I filled out fields like the trip code, name, number of days, start date, resort name, cost per person, image file name, and a short description. After entering the details, I clicked the "Save" button, which triggered the logic to store the new trip information into the backend database.
<h1>Trip added to UI in SPA</h1>

Once the trip was added, it appeared on the main user interface of the single-page application. I built this part of the UI to dynamically display all trips stored in the database. Each trip is shown in a card format with its name, description, duration, and price. This confirmed that the trip I just added was correctly saved and rendered through the application.
<h1>Editing the trip</h1>

After making edits, I clicked the "Save" button, and the updated information was saved to the backend. The changes were immediately reflected on the UI, confirming that my update logic worked correctly. I verified that the revised trip details replaced the old ones without needing a page reload.

<h1>What I learned</h1>
Working on the Travlr application in CS 465 Web Application Development gave me real experience in planning, designing, and building a complete web-based software project. This assignment helped me grow the skills I need as a software engineer, such as both front-end and back-end development, organizing code, and using version control tools like Git. I learned how to create a multi-page application, design user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and connect those pages to dynamic content through server-side logic.

The project also helped me understand the importance of writing clean code and creating responsive layouts that work well on different devices. I practiced using wireframes, building forms, managing user data, and designing page flows that made sense for the user. Most importantly, this project taught me how to think through problems like a software engineer by breaking tasks into smaller steps, testing regularly, and focusing on how users interact with the system. This hands-on experience gave me more confidence in my ability to contribute to real software teams and projects.
