I started the Computer Science program in September 2020 and have studied for about five years. I joined the program to improve my background in programming and developing applications and web services. I chose this path because I have always been passionate about working with computers and technology. I enjoy web development and have also led some IT projects and helped set up IT systems while working in the field of architecture.

During my time in the Computer Science program, I learned and improved many skills and gained a lot of knowledge. I became better at paying attention to details and thinking about security, which are both very important for working as a software engineer and developer. I also learned how to stay organized and careful when writing code by breaking it into smaller parts and testing it step by step. Testing is very important to make sure a program works well and does not have weaknesses or problems, and it becomes even more important as a project gets bigger and more complex. Thinking like a tester and always keeping security in mind are skills I continue to improve.

Working on big projects helped me learn how important the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is. I also learned how to use project management strategies whether I am working alone or with a team. Planning a large project takes a lot of organization, and it is important to work well with other people. Understanding what a client wants is part of the SDLC, and I learned how to turn those needs into algorithms and code. Being able to do that feels great and rewarding. These experiences have helped me improve soft skills like creativity, communication, time management, and teamwork.

Paying close attention to detail is an important part of writing high-quality code. It connects to reviewing code carefully, following security rules, and using professional coding practices. I learned that thinking about security early in a project is better than waiting until the end. This mindset supports a “zero trust” approach, which makes my code safer and more reliable. When I check my own code or review someone else’s, I often find small problems that were missed during development. Following coding standards and using clear formatting helps me write software that is easy to understand and fix later. I also ask classmates or coworkers to review my work. When someone else looks at it with fresh eyes, they can spot mistakes I may have overlooked. These experiences have helped me become better at catching details and sharing ideas clearly.

My experience as a U.S. Army veteran played a big role in building these habits. In the Army, I learned how to follow instructions, stay calm under pressure, and work with others as a team. I supported large military operations and handled important data for over 250 soldiers at a time. I helped develop and improve tracking systems using Excel and Python, which are now used by the U.S. Army TRADOC across many locations. I also worked with soldiers from other countries, including NATO forces, during training exercises in Europe. These experiences made me strong at solving problems, managing time, and communicating clearly with different groups of people. I now bring those same values to software development.

Throughout this program and my time in the military, I became more confident in learning new skills quickly. I approach problems with curiosity and a leadership attitude. My work in software development, data analysis, and technical writing is shown clearly in the artifacts in my ePortfolio. These skills, along with my military discipline and experience, make me a strong candidate for a software engineering role. I focus on writing code that not only works for computers, but is also clear and easy for people to understand and build on.

Each course in the Computer Science program has played an important role in helping me gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to pursue a career in this field. While I have learned a great deal outside of the classroom, certain courses had a greater impact and helped shape the direction I originally set out to follow when I joined the program. These courses helped me discover strengths I didn’t realize I had and gave me the chance to grow in areas I had not explored before. Because of that, I selected artifacts that clearly demonstrate and highlight the skills I gained from these experiences.

In CS250 Software Development Lifecycle, I learned how important the development process is and how strong communication with team members and clients supports a project’s success. IT145 Foundation in Application Development and CS260 Data Structures and Algorithms taught me valuable lessons about algorithms and data structures. These courses helped me strengthen my ability to design and evaluate solutions to real-world problems using proper computer science methods and design trade-offs. CS310 Collaboration and Team Project helped me understand the value of teamwork and showed how essential collaboration is for completing large-scale projects.

<h6>Thermostat Lab Guide - CS350 Emerging Systems Architecture and Technologies</h6>

CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming and CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization helped me understand the complexity of software design and computer graphics. In both courses, I showed that I could apply strong and creative techniques, tools, and skills to build computing solutions that add value and meet goals in the industry. CS340 Client and Server Development and DAT220 Fundamentals of Data Mining taught me how to create and use databases and showed how helpful data can be when solving problems. These courses also helped me learn how to create team environments where different people can work together and support decision-making in computer science.

The course artifacts I chose for the code reviews and the main categories of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases come from three different projects. Each one gave me a chance to use what I learned in class. I believe the changes I made to these projects show my growth and prove my skills in the computer science program.

The Computer Science program has helped me grow as a professional and has prepared me to build a meaningful and successful career. I am now ready to make valuable contributions to the field of computer science. Like a climber reaching the top of a mountain, I feel a renewed sense of motivation and focus. I have created an ePortfolio that reflects my place among computer science professionals, and I am proud of this achievement.

My ePortfolio shows that I can use solid and creative techniques. I built computer solutions that provide real value and meet specific goals in the industry. One example of this is my project where I worked with CSV data files, importing them into MongoDB, using the PyMongo driver, Python libraries, the Dash framework, and a CRUD module. These tools allowed me to manage the data and build useful web-based features.

I also designed and improved solutions that solve problems using algorithmic thinking and strong computer science practices. I made careful design choices by working with classes, methods, arguments, and variables in Java. Each artifact I enhanced shows my focus on security. I worked to spot possible weaknesses, reduce design flaws, and protect private data and resources.

I am excited to take on new challenges that help me grow. I stay committed to completing my work, even when it is difficult. I believe in asking for help when needed, and I see it as a way to learn from more experienced coworkers and mentors. I want to be part of a team that works together to build creative and useful solutions. I bring strong organization skills, a love of learning, and a positive attitude. I am ready to explore new technologies and build the skills needed to succeed. I am motivated to keep pushing forward and to do my best in every opportunity.

<h1 id = "artifactOne">Artifact One - Travlr Application - Full Stack</h1><h2><a href="#top">Back to top</a></h2>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Jbryson88/ePortfolio/tree/main/enhancement/CS%20465%20-%20Full%20Stack%20Software%20Development">CS465 Enhancement</a></h3>

The artifact I chose for this milestone is my Travlr App. This is a web application that helps users plan and organize trips. It lets users create an account, log in, save trip details, add destinations, and see an itinerary. I originally created this app in my Web Application Development course.
Why I Selected This Artifact
I selected the Travlr App because it shows many important skills in software design and engineering. It has a full stack architecture with a front end, back end, and a database, which demonstrates my ability to design and build a complete application. Some parts of the app that showcase my skills include the registration and login system with password hashing, the CRUD operations for trips and destinations, and the clean and responsive user interface.
For this milestone, I completed a set of enhancements to improve the app’s quality. I improved the backend by fixing response logic and adding better input validation to the trips.js controller. I improved error handling and replaced unclear errors with specific, helpful messages. On the frontend, I added a responsive navigation bar, breadcrumbs to show users where they are in the site, and better input validation on the contact form. I also updated the CSS to include media queries for better mobile and tablet responsiveness.

These enhancements helped me meet some of the program’s outcomes, like using solid software engineering practices and tools, and improving security in my design by validating user input. My outcome coverage plan has not changed because my enhancements stayed focused on making the app more secure, maintainable, and user-friendly.
Reflection on the Process
Working on these enhancements taught me a lot about why clean and secure code matters. I learned how moving business logic into cleaner, more maintainable code and adding good validation make the app more reliable. I also learned how responsive design and user-friendly error messages improve usability. A challenge I faced was making sure my backend changes didn’t break existing functionality and testing my CSS changes on different screen sizes. Overall, I am proud of the improvements I made and feel more confident in my ability to deliver professional-quality software.

<H1 >Add Trip</H1>
<img width="75%" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jbryson88/ePortfolio/refs/heads/main/enhancement/CS%20465%20-%20Full%20Stack%20Software%20Development/Add%20Trip.png"/>
</div>

I created a form that allowed me to add a new trip to the system. I filled out fields like the trip code, name, number of days, start date, resort name, cost per person, image file name, and a short description. After entering the details, I clicked the "Save" button, which triggered the logic to store the new trip information into the backend database.

<div>
<h1>Trip added to UI in SPA</h1>
<img width="85%" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jbryson88/ePortfolio/refs/heads/main/enhancement/CS%20465%20-%20Full%20Stack%20Software%20Development/Trip%20UI%20in%20SPA.png"/>
</div>

Once the trip was added, it appeared on the main user interface of the single-page application. I built this part of the UI to dynamically display all trips stored in the database. Each trip is shown in a card format with its name, description, duration, and price. This confirmed that the trip I just added was correctly saved and rendered through the application.

<div>
<h1>Editing the trip</h1>
<img width="85%" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jbryson88/ePortfolio/refs/heads/main/enhancement/CS%20465%20-%20Full%20Stack%20Software%20Development/Edit%20Trip.png"/>
</div>

Next, I clicked the "Edit Trip" button on one of the displayed trip cards. This opened a pre-filled form where I could update the trip’s details. I changed values such as the trip name, resort name, number of days, image, and description. This form allowed me to modify existing trip data easily.

<div>
<h1>Trip updated in both database and displayed in UI</h1>
<img width="85%" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jbryson88/ePortfolio/refs/heads/main/enhancement/CS%20465%20-%20Full%20Stack%20Software%20Development/Updated%20Trip.png"/>
</div>

After making edits, I clicked the "Save" button, and the updated information was saved to the backend. The changes were immediately reflected on the UI, confirming that my update logic worked correctly. I verified that the revised trip details replaced the old ones without needing a page reload.

<h1>What I learned</h1>
Working on the Travlr application in CS 465 Web Application Development gave me real experience in planning, designing, and building a complete web-based software project. This assignment helped me grow the skills I need as a software engineer, such as both front-end and back-end development, organizing code, and using version control tools like Git. I learned how to create a multi-page application, design user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and connect those pages to dynamic content through server-side logic.

The project also helped me understand the importance of writing clean code and creating responsive layouts that work well on different devices. I practiced using wireframes, building forms, managing user data, and designing page flows that made sense for the user. Most importantly, this project taught me how to think through problems like a software engineer by breaking tasks into smaller steps, testing regularly, and focusing on how users interact with the system. This hands-on experience gave me more confidence in my ability to contribute to real software teams and projects.

<h1 id="artifactTwo">Artifact 2 - Inventory App - Android Mobile Application</h1><h2><a href="#top">Back to top</a></h2>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Jbryson88/ePortfolio/tree/main/enhancement/CS360-softwaredesign">CS360 Enhancement</a></h3>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this, I had to pretend I am part of the Mobile2App team, and we were hired to help develop a mobile application called the Inventory App. This app is designed to track items in a warehouse. The project goes through several steps — planning, designing, and developing — and will be ready to launch in the coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
Our team took time to understand the goals of the app and the needs of the users so we could build the right solution. We meet every week to review client requests, discuss progress, and assign tasks. Throughout the process, we apply good mobile app development principles and best practices.
</p>

<p>
The Goal: The Inventory App helps track inventory items through mobile devices. For example, warehouse workers can use the app to manage and automate logistics, which helps the business grow and expand. The app gives users real-time inventory information that can be accessed from anywhere on an Android device.
</p>

<p>
To meet these goals, the app was requested to include these features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A database with at least two tables: one for inventory items and one for user logins and passwords.</li>
  <li>A sign-in or sign-up screen.</li>
  <li>A screen that displays all inventory items in a grid.</li>
  <li>A way for users to add and remove items from the inventory.</li>
  <li>A way for users to increase or decrease the quantity of specific items.</li>
  <li>A notification that alerts users when an item’s quantity reaches zero.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This project shows my ability to design software by understanding user needs and turning those needs into an organized program. It is important to connect the user interface design and layout with the programming part of the app.
</p>

<p>
As a developer, I start by planning and thinking about the purpose of the app and who will use it. Every group of users is different, so it is important to focus on what they need the most and build those features first. It also helps to look at similar apps to see how they solve similar problems, especially in how they design the user experience. Searching the app store or online for similar apps is a very important step.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot of information about how to design a good mobile app, and understanding that process is key to making an app that users will like. It is not realistic to think you can make a great app completely on your own. That’s why it is important to work as a team and help each other, from the first planning step to the final launch. Building a strong, collaborative team is essential to follow good practices, improve the design and code, and find new ways to make the app better and meet challenges.
</p>

<p>
Reflection: This project shows my ability to use solid and creative techniques, skills, and tools in computing to create solutions that deliver real value based on industry needs. The project covered the full process of designing and engineering software, including making sure the app was easy to use and understanding how users would interact with the different screens and actions. I also used standard icons and symbols and designed a database that allows users to create, read, update, and delete inventory data.
</p>

<p>
I designed and tested solutions to problems by using good algorithms and following computer science standards. I balanced different design choices while thinking about how the algorithms, data structures, classes, methods, and layouts all work together. I also developed a strong security mindset by thinking about possible weaknesses, reducing risks, and protecting data and privacy. I improved security by checking input data and designing with a focus on safety and default protections.

<h1 id = "artifactThree">Artifact Three - Salvare Search (Web Rescue Application)</h1><h2><a href="#top">Back to top</a></h2>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Jbryson88/ePortfolio/tree/main/enhancement/CS340%20-%20Client%3AServer%20Development">CS340 Enhancement</a></h3>

<h1>Artifact Overview</h1>
      
The artifact I selected for the databases category is the Salvare Search for Rescue Web App. I created this project during the CS340 Client/Server Development course. It is a web application built in Python using the Dash framework and the MongoDB database. The app helps animal shelters organize and search through their dog records to identify good candidates for rescue training. The database uses a CSV file of shelter dogs that gets imported into MongoDB. The application can be run in Jupyter Notebook or the computer terminal using a browser.

<h1>Why This Artifact Was Chosen</h1>
I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it shows strong database and web development skills. It uses a real-world data structure, connects to a non-relational database, and follows the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern. The MVC pattern helps separate the different parts of the app. The model handles the data using MongoDB and Python. The view uses Dash to show the user what they see on the screen. The controller uses PyMongo to update and pull data from the database.

This artifact also includes RESTful API practices, which are very common in professional software development. I improved the code by recreating the project in a Windows environment. Originally, it was built using Apporto, which is a Linux platform. I followed the original documentation to rebuild the project and updated it with new steps for using Windows. I also had to update parts of the code to work with newer versions of PyMongo and MongoDB.

<h1>Meeting Course Outcomes</h1>
Yes, I met the course outcomes I planned for this enhancement. My goal was to improve my skills in using databases, following secure coding practices, and documenting my work clearly. I now better understand how to set up a database connection, validate user input, and use version changes in database tools. I also learned to organize and format my code to make it easier to read and maintain. I do not have any changes to my outcome plans right now.


<h1>Reflection on Enhancing the Artifact</h1>
Improving this project taught me a lot about working in different operating systems. Since the original app was built in a remote Linux lab, I had to set up Python, Dash, and MongoDB from scratch on my personal Windows machine. It was hard to match everything exactly, especially since newer software versions required changes to the original code. I had to modify the Create method in the CRUD module to match PyMongo version 4.0.

This process improved my ability to solve technical problems on my own. I also learned how to write clear instructions and update project documentation so others can follow it. I used Python best practices, like in-line comments, clean formatting, and proper naming for functions and variables. I also worked hard to make sure every part of the app followed security-minded programming, like checking inputs and controlling access to the database.

Overall, this project shows how I can build a working database application, improve it to work in new environments, and document everything clearly for future use. It fits well in my ePortfolio and proves my growth in using databases in real-world applications.
