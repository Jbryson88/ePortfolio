# About Me

This repository explains how I created my ePortfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone final project. Making a professional portfolio is one of the best ways to show employers my unique skills and talents. The ePortfolio is a good way to clearly present my abilities in the main areas of Computer Science. It includes work from different courses in the program that shows how I have grown in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

Some of the projects show my skills in one area while also showing strengths in other areas. As part of my own practice, I improved the projects and made them better than what the courses required. I fixed problems, improved quality, and made them more secure. The portfolio shows that I am highly motivated, organized, and skilled as a Computer Science major focusing on Software Engineering.

I started the Computer Science program in September 2020 and have studied for about five years. I joined the program to improve my background in programming and developing applications and web services. I chose this path because I have always been passionate about working with computers and technology. I enjoy web development and have also led some IT projects and helped set up IT systems while working in the field of architecture.

During my time in the Computer Science program, I learned and improved many skills and gained a lot of knowledge. I became better at paying attention to details and thinking about security, which are both very important for working as a software engineer and developer. I also learned how to stay organized and careful when writing code by breaking it into smaller parts and testing it step by step. Testing is very important to make sure a program works well and does not have weaknesses or problems, and it becomes even more important as a project gets bigger and more complex. Thinking like a tester and always keeping security in mind are skills I continue to improve.

Working on big projects helped me learn how important the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is. I also learned how to use project management strategies whether I am working alone or with a team. Planning a large project takes a lot of organization, and it is important to work well with other people. Understanding what a client wants is part of the SDLC, and I learned how to turn those needs into algorithms and code. Being able to do that feels great and rewarding. These experiences have helped me improve soft skills like creativity, communication, time management, and teamwork.

Paying close attention to detail is an important part of writing high-quality code. It connects to reviewing code carefully, following security rules, and using professional coding practices. I learned that thinking about security early in a project is better than waiting until the end. This mindset supports a “zero trust” approach, which makes my code safer and more reliable. When I check my own code or review someone else’s, I often find small problems that were missed during development. Following coding standards and using clear formatting helps me write software that is easy to understand and fix later. I also ask classmates or coworkers to review my work. When someone else looks at it with fresh eyes, they can spot mistakes I may have overlooked. These experiences have helped me become better at catching details and sharing ideas clearly.

My experience as a U.S. Army veteran played a big role in building these habits. In the Army, I learned how to follow instructions, stay calm under pressure, and work with others as a team. I supported large military operations and handled important data for over 250 soldiers at a time. I helped develop and improve tracking systems using Excel and Python, which are now used by the U.S. Army TRADOC across many locations. I also worked with soldiers from other countries, including NATO forces, during training exercises in Europe. These experiences made me strong at solving problems, managing time, and communicating clearly with different groups of people. I now bring those same values to software development.

Throughout this program and my time in the military, I became more confident in learning new skills quickly. I approach problems with curiosity and a leadership attitude. My work in software development, data analysis, and technical writing is shown clearly in the artifacts in my ePortfolio. These skills, along with my military discipline and experience, make me a strong candidate for a software engineering role. I focus on writing code that not only works for computers, but is also clear and easy for people to understand and build on.

Each course in the Computer Science program has played an important role in helping me gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to pursue a career in this field. While I have learned a great deal outside of the classroom, certain courses had a greater impact and helped shape the direction I originally set out to follow when I joined the program. These courses helped me discover strengths I didn’t realize I had and gave me the chance to grow in areas I had not explored before. Because of that, I selected artifacts that clearly demonstrate and highlight the skills I gained from these experiences.

In CS250 Software Development Lifecycle, I learned how important the development process is and how strong communication with team members and clients supports a project’s success. IT145 Foundation in Application Development and CS260 Data Structures and Algorithms taught me valuable lessons about algorithms and data structures. These courses helped me strengthen my ability to design and evaluate solutions to real-world problems using proper computer science methods and design trade-offs. CS310 Collaboration and Team Project helped me understand the value of teamwork and showed how essential collaboration is for completing large-scale projects.

CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming and CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization helped me understand the complexity of software design and computer graphics. In both courses, I showed that I could apply strong and creative techniques, tools, and skills to build computing solutions that add value and meet goals in the industry. CS340 Client and Server Development and DAT220 Fundamentals of Data Mining taught me how to create and use databases and showed how helpful data can be when solving problems. These courses also helped me learn how to create team environments where different people can work together and support decision-making in computer science.

The course artifacts I chose for the code reviews and the main categories of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases come from three different projects. Each one gave me a chance to use what I learned in class. I believe the changes I made to these projects show my growth and prove my skills in the computer science program.
